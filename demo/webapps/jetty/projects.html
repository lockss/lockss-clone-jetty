<H1>Jetty Projects</H1>

One of the key design aims of the Jetty is to be very flexible and
embeddable, so that it can be used stand alone, or embedded within other projects or products.
As such, many extentions and embeddings of Jetty have developed.  Some of
these projects are managed as part of the Jetty project, some are
collaborations with other projects, while many more are totally independant
(see the <A href="http://www.mortbay.com/mortbay/powered.html">Jetty
Powered</A> page).
