QUESTION: Can Jetty do Single Sign On Authentication?

By their nature, BASIC and DIGEST authentication support single sign (SSO) on as
the client send the same credentials to all webapplications on the same host
address.
<p>
For FORM authentication, more support is required as the browser/client is
not part of the authentication implementation.  Jetty support SSOs for FORM
authentication by defining a SSORealm interface. UserRealm implementations
that also implement the SSORealm interface are used by the FormAuthenticator
in SSO mode.  
<p>
The HashUserRealm provided with Jetty implements SSORealm by delegating to
a configured SSORealm implementation. The HashSSORealm implementation is
provided to support basic non-distributed SSO functionality.
<p> 
The sample configuration file demoSSO.xml runs the Jetty demo twice
in SSO mode at /jetty0 and /jetty1. Logging into one instance will enable SSO
authentication in the other.
