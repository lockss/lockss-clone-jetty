QUESTION: What is web.xml?

The web.xml file is the standard deployment descriptor that can be found at WEB-INF/web.xml within
a standard web application or WAR file.  It's format is determined by DTD (&lt;2.3) or XML Schema (2.4)
and is described in the servlet specification, in many web tutorials and many good servlet books.
<p>
The web.xml file allows servlets and filters to be declared and mapped to locations in the URL space.
Declaritive security, welcome files and J2EE integration are also dealt with by web.xml elements.
