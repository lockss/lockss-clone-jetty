QUESTION: How do I configure logging?

<p>
Jetty contains logging mechanisms for requests, servlet contexts, container 
implementation and support for logging mechanisms including log4j, commons logging,
Java 1.4 and a Jetty native logger.
</p>
<p>
The configuration of these logging mechanisms is described in the 
<a href="/jetty/tut/logging.html">Jetty Tutorial</a>.
